What is the demo about?

Using a practical application, like a game, helps understand object-oriented principles better and makes them relatable.

Focusing on the "why" behind object-oriented programming is essential, as it is often overlooked.

The example game simplifies the concepts by using real-world animal entities and their behaviors.

The series gradually improves the code by incorporating object-oriented principles, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

UI and graphics are not the focus; instead, the emphasis is on building a hierarchy and classification of entities.

The concepts discussed in the series are applicable to any programming language that supports object-oriented programming.

The example game can be helpful for interview preparation, as object-oriented programming is a common topic.

Requirements of the fictitious game:

The attributes and behaviours of the Animals!

Cat
    Has a name
    can eat
    can climb on roofs

Dog
    Has a name
    can eat
    can climb on steps

Parrot
    Has a name
    can eat
    can climb on trees
    can fly

What the App must do for now:
    Upon starting all the animals must do what they know!
    
Later
    The parrot can sing, 
    A new animal, an eagle, needs to be introduced. Eagle cannot sing!
